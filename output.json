I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"........."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......and then we reached Nibelheim."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"How does it feel? It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right? So how does it feel? I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Ummm... how 'bout your parents?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"What does it matter...? All right, let's go."},{"name":"Barret","line":"I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the Shinra building."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"That's right."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Barret, would you please let us hear what Cloud has to say? You can ask questions later."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Tifa, I was only......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Okay Cloud, continue."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"It's a reunion of childhood pals!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......I was really surprised with Tifa."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"We leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep early."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"All we need is one lookout, so you others, get some rest."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Oh, that's right... You may visit your family and friends."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...No, I'll come here later."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"And who are you?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Did you say Tifa?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"...This scenery...... I feel like I know this place."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"...We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"...Trust me."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I'll be all right, Dad! I have two men from SOLDIER with me."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I'm Tifa. Nice to meet you!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Tifa! You're the guide?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"That's right. I just happen to be the number one guide in this town."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"It's too dangerous! I can't involve you in something like this!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Then there's no problem if you protect her."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"...Let's go."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Everyone seems to be all right. Can we get back to where we were?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"These caves are intertwined, just like an ant farm... Oh, and Sephiroth... There seems to be one person missing..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"It may sound cold, but we've got no time to search for him. We can't go back now, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"A mysteriously colored cave..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"It must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"A Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"It's so beautiful..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"If the Mako Reactor continues to suck up the energy, this fountain will dry up too..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Materia. When you condense Mako energy, materia is produced. It's very rare to be able to see materia in its natural state."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"By the way... Why is it that when you use materia you can also use magic too?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"You were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that? ...the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the materia. Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the Land and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the planet calling up magic...... or so they say."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Magic...... a mysterious power..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Ha, ha, ha!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Did I say somethin' funny?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"A man once told me never to use an unscientific term such as mysterious power! It shouldn't even be called 'magic'! I still remember how angry he was."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Who was that?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Hojo of Shinra, Inc. ... An inexperienced man assigned to take over the work of a great scientist. He was a walking mass of complexes."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"A Mako fountain... So this is where the knowledge of the Ancients is."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Tifa, you wait here."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I'm going inside too! I wanna see!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Only authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of Shinra's industrial secrets."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"But!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Take care of the lady."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Mm, man! Better take real good care of me then!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"This is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken. Cloud, close the valve."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"...now I see, Hojo. But, even doing this, will never put you on the same level as Professor Gast. This is a system that condenses and freezes the Mako energy... that is, when it's working correctly. Now... what does Mako energy become when it's further condensed?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Uh, umm...... Oh yeah! It becomes a Materia."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Right, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. ...Take a look."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered with Mako. You're different from the others, but still human. But, what are they? They've been exposed to a high degree of Mako, far more than you."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...is this some kind of monster?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Exactly. And it's Hojo of Shinra that produced these monsters. Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what these monster's really are."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"H... hey, Sephiroth!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"N... no...... ...Was I?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"...Was I created this way too? Am I the same as all these monsters......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...Sephiroth."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"You saw it! All of them... were humans..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Human!? No way!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"...I've always felt since I was small... That I was different from the others. Special, in some way. But... not like this..."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Damn, Shinra! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held a secret like that."},{"name":"Barret","line":"(Why you talkin' to me!?)"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Tifa... You were waiting outside then?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......Yes."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself at the inn. He didn't even try to talk to me."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"The villagers used to call it Shinra mansion."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova confirmed to be an Ancient... X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova Project approved. The use of Mako Reactor 1 approved for use..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"My mother's name is Jenova... Jenova Project... Is this just a coincidence?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Professor Gast... Why didn't you tell me anything? ...Why did you die?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Hmph... traitor."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Traitor?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"You ignorant traitor. I'll tell you. This Planet originally belonged to the Cetra. Cetra was a itinerant race. They would migrate in, settle the Planet, then move on... At the end of their harsh, hard journey, they would find the Promised Land and supreme happiness."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"But, those that disliked the journey appeared. Those who stopped their migrations built shelters and elected to lead an easier life. They took that which the Cetra and the planet had made without giving back one whit in return! Those are your ancestors."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sephiroth..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Long ago, disaster struck this planet. Your ancestors escaped... They survived because they hid. The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra. After that, your ancestors continued to increase. Now all that's left of the Cetra is in these reports."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What does that have to do with you?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Don't you get it? An Ancient named Jenova was found in the geological stratum of 2000 years ago. The Jenova Project."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"The Jenova Project wanted to produce people with the powers of the Ancients...... no, the Cetra. ...I am the one that was produced."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Pr... produced!?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Yes. Professor Gast, leader of the Jenova Project and genius scientist, produced me."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"How... how did he...?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Se... Sephiroth?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Out of my way. I'm going to see my mother."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything! I hate them all!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"How could you do that to papa and all the townspeople?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sephiroth... My family! My hometown! How could you do this to them!?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Ha, ha, ha...... They've come again, mother. With her superior power, knowledge, and magic, Mother was destined to become the ruler of this Planet."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"But they... Those worthless creatures are stealing the planet from Mother"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"But now I'm here with you so don't worry"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What about MY sadness!? My family... friends... The sadness of having my hometown taken away from me!? It's the same as your sadness!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Ha, ha, ha... my sadness? What do I have to be sad about? I am the chosen one. I have been chosen to be the leader of this Planet."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"I have orders to take this planet back from you stupid people for the Cetra. What am I supposed to be sad about?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sephiroth... I trusted you... No, you're not the Sephiroth I used to know!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......and that's the end of my story."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Wait a damn minute! Ain't there more?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......I don't remember."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"What happened to Sephiroth?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the newspaper."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Shinra, Inc. owns the paper, so you can't rely on that information."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened then. I challenged Sephiroth and lived. Why didn't he kill me?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......I'm alive, too."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Seems like a lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? It was in the Shinra building, right?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Shinra shipped it from Nibelheim to Midgar."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Did someone else carry it out after that? It was missing from the Shinra building."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Sephiroth......?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Damn! Don't none of this make sense! I'm going, going, going, gone! And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Yo, Cloud! Let's get a move on!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Oh brother......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......... Cloud...? How bad was I when Sephiroth cut me?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I thought you were a goner. ......I was really sad."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"........."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"I... The Ancients...... Cetra...... Jenova...... Sephiroth and myself......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Let's go. Barret's waiting."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Mmm......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Kidnapping, right?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...that's how it is."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Great..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Hey! Hold on, we're coming!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Mouth to mouth!?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"But,... she's just a girl......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Guess I gotta do it..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Yeah..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"You again? ...Who are you?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"5 Years ago...Nibelheim?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Yeah...I was surprised."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...I dunno."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...You're right."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...I don't know. I can't remember clearly..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...Yeah."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Hey wake up. Wake up, Cloud!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Tifa... When Sephiroth and I went to Nibelheim, where were you?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"...We saw each other, right?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"The other time."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"No...it was 5 years ago. I don't remember. But, something seems strange outside. Cloud, come quick."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"That's all right."},{"name":"Barret","line":"What's that music? It sure sounds lively."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Rufus!? I gotta pay my respects."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"You think Rufus is thinking about crossing the ocean from here, too? What? Does that mean Sephiroth already crossed the ocean?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"We gotta get to the town up there... Mebbe we could climb the tower?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"High voltage tower...... I guess this means Cloud'll be all right."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Yeah, better leave it to Cloud!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Hey!!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Wait a second!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Now ain't that something! I ain't never seen no Dolphin jump like that!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"A gift? What am I supposed to do with it!?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Jump to the top of the pole?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Good luck Cloud! If you make it, we'll follow you!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Whoa, I'll hold the PHS for you. It'll break if it gets wet."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"It's the Shinra uniform."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I wonder when it was... ...I couldn't stand wearing this thing anymore."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Uh...yea......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Man in a Black Cape?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Let's see... My best move is..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"How did you get here?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...even if we are wearing Shinra's uniforms..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"...But, you know what? I really hate this uniform. Uniforms, soldiers, war, I hate 'em all. They take away all the things and people you love... I wish they'd all disappear. Right, Cloud?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"God!! I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna settle things here and now......"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Damn, did they find us!?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Hey, that don't seem like us. Do they mean...Tifa and the others!?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Get off your spikey butt and let's go, Cloud!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"You all right!?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Huh?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Everyone's here...right?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Hey, wait. You don't think that suspicious character is... Sephiroth!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Really!?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"How the hell am I supposed to know!?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...Let's find out."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"No...not Sephiroth!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"......After a long sleep... ...the time...... ...time has......come..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sephiroth!

Be more......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...Jenova. The arm of Jenova."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"So it WAS Sephiroth."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......Time...is now?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Oh, too bad. I liked Barret's sailor suit. He looked so cute."},{"name":"Barret","line":"......What'ya mean \"cute\"?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Right...well, uh... Barret, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas? Right, Cloud?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"All right. We'll take a break and then head off. Don't wander too far off."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Hmmm!?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Marlene! You ok?......"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Dad'll wear this when I go to see you."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Uh uh!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Look, look at that!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Hm...?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Hojo......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......What are you doing?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Answer me!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"You mean Sephiroth?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What is it?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I'll go anywhere Sephiroth is at! To beat him and put an end to all this!"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"I'm Aeris. The least you can do is remember my name. I want you to tell me something, Professor Hojo... I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"You didn't know!? She died."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Professor Hojo... Is Jenova an Ancient? Is Sephiroth an Ancient? Do we all have the same blood?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"He's mumbling slowly... That must means he's hiding something!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Hey! Answer us!!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......It's no use. It's no go."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Hee, hee, hee!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Ha, ha...oh stop it! That's right.

Heard it got buried... in just 4 years."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"But how could those people say those terrible things?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"An' it's my fault. ALL my fault."},{"name":"Barret","line":"There was an explosion at a reactor. Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a rebel faction."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"That's so terrible!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I couldn't forgive myself. Never should've gone along with the building of the reactor..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra made back then."},{"name":"Barret","line":"That's why... that's why I get so pissed off!! Not only did they take advantage of me...... But I lost my wife, Myrna, too..."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"I know this isn't the right time to do this."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Hey, Barret, cheer up!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"......I ain't in no cheery mood.

Even here..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Then can you tell me where a man named Sephiroth is?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...Ordinary luck. It will be an active fortune.

He was deceived by the Shinra too. He'll probably join us to fight against the Shinra."},{"name":"Barret","line":"...wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can rest in peace.

Actually, they didn't need words from the beginning because there was only one objective for those left in the Temple."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Please, talk to me!"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"No good. I don't understand the rest. Are you afraid...? Is it because Sephiroth is in the Temple? Or something else?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Everyone all right? That sure took a lot out of us."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Oh no...Cloud. Come quick!!"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Hurry, this way!"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"It's full of the knowledge of the Ancients.

It's showing us!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"So you opened the door. Well done."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"A lost treasure house of knowledge. The wisdom of the Ancients...."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"I am becoming one with the Planet."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"You stupid fools. You have never even thought about it. All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom...knowledge... I will meld with it all. I will become one with it... it will become one with me."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"The way......lies here. Only death awaits you all. But do not fear.

I'm taking him out!"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"You must be tired."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Where are you!? Sephiroth!!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"So cold. I am always by your side."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Come."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I don't understand what you're saying!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"At what!?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"At that which adds to the knowledge of... I am becoming one with the Planet."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Soon... we will become one."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"How do you intend to become one with the Planet?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"It's simple. Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the injury. The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the injury."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"...What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the very life of the Planet? Think how much energy would be gathered."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me. All that boundless energy will be mine. By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a new life form, a new existence. Melding with the Planet... I will cease to exist as I am now... Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet? Injure...the Planet?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Behold that mural. The Ultimate Destructive Magic...Meteor."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"That'll never happen!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Where are you!? Sephiroth!!"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Wait, Cloud!"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Cloud!!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Ha ha ha ... Black Materia."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Ha ha ha ... Call Meteor."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Cloud!! Get a hold of yourself!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Cloud... I'm... Cloud..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"How should I?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...I remember! I remember my way."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"...Cloud."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Mm? What's wrong? Is something wrong?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"...It's nothing so don't worry about it."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Right, Cloud! It's nothing."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Sephiroth got away."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...Don't worry about it. I understood what he was saying. So this must be Meteor, right?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"...this must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying. The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor. It finds small drifting planets with its magic. And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out entirely..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sephiroth!?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Ha ha ha... It is not me."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"He disappeared."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"...There's something written on it."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"...B.l.a.c.k......M.a.t.e.r.i.a."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Black Materia!!"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Hey! ...Black Materia. What should we do, Cloud?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"I don't understand......"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"What?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Really!?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"They said that the Temple itself is the Black Materia."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What do they mean?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"So, this whole building is the Black Materia?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia!? Then no one could take it."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple. And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve a puzzle. As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too. Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"So, if we solve the puzzles, the Black Materia will get smaller and smaller and we can take it out?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Yes, but there's one thing... You can only answer the puzzles inside the Temple. So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I see... the Ancients didn't want dangerous magic to be taken out of the Temple so easily..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"No. We've got to think of a way to get it out. Because Sephiroth has lots of different flunkies. It's nothing to him to throw their lives away to get the Black Materia. This place isn't safe."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"So what are we going to do?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia. And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Cloud... ...behind you."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Cait Sith..."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Come on, Cloud... Say something."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I'm not good at this."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Why don't you read our fortunes?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Hmm, let's see how compatible Cloud and I are!"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"No! Tell me! I promise I won't get mad!"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Be strong Cait Sith!!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"As long as we have this, Sephiroth won't be able to use Meteor."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Mmm? Can you guys use it?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power to use it."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"You mean lots of Spiritual energy?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"That's right. One person's power alone won't do it. Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's energy... Oh yeah! The Promised Land!!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"The Promised Land!! No, but..."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"He shouldn't be able to find the Promised Land."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"...Ah, but I have."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"I'm far superior to the Ancients. I became a traveler of the Lifestream and gained the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients. I also gained the knowledge and wisdom of those after the extinction of the Ancients. And soon, I will create the future."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"I won't let you do it! The future is not only yours!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Ha, ha, ha...I wonder?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Wake up!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sh...shut up!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"The...Noise..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"There, Cloud...good boy."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Wa......aaaa......aaa..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"......Well done."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Cloud, are you all right?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...I gave the Black Materia to Sephiroth...?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Wha...what did I do... tell me, Aeris."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Cloud...be strong, OK?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Urrrrrrgh... What have I done!?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Cloud... you haven't done anything. It's not your fault."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I...! I'm-----!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Everything is white... What did I do? I don't remember anything..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"My memory...since when...? If everything's a dream, don't wake me."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Yeah, I hear you. Sorry for what happened."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Don't worry about it."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...I can't help it..."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"Oh... Then, why don't you REALLY worry about it? And let me handle Sephiroth. And Cloud, you take care of yourself. So you don't have a breakdown,okay?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What is this place?"},{"name":"Aeris","line":"This forest leads to the City of the Ancients... and is called the Sleeping Forest. It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor. That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the Cetra, like me, can do it."},{"name":"Aeris","line":"The secret is just up here. At least it should be. ...I feel it. It feels like I'm being led by something.  Then, I'll be going now. I'll come back when it's all over."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Aeris?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Hmm...... She's thinking of interfering? She will be a difficult one, don't you think?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"We must stop that girl soon."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"You know, Cloud. Aeris is gone."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Everyone's out looking for Aeris."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......City of the Ancients. Aeris is headed there."},{"name":"Barret","line":"By herself!? Why did she go by herself!?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Hey, we're goin' too."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Only the Ancients, only Aeris can save us from Meteor..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to Aeris? If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sephiroth...already knows."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Let's go, Cloud."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"No. I might lose it again. If Sephiroth comes near me I might......"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Yeah, godammit! It's 'cuz of you that Sephiroth got the Black Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"My fault?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"I know you got problems... hell, we all do. But you don't even understand yourself."},{"name":"Barret","line":"But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this train we're on, till we get to the end of the line."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud, we came this far... Aren't you going to settle up with Sephiroth?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"No... I'm afraid. If this keeps up, I may go crazy! I'm afraid..."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Just a damn jackass, that's what you are...\nYo, jes' think about it... How many people in this world do ya think really understand themselves? People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up. But, they go on living. They don't run away... Isn't that how it is?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud...you'll come with us, right? I believe in you."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What...am I supposed to do? Pull out of here? Pull out? ...To where?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud..."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Wait a minute, Tifa. Give him a little time. He has to decide this on his own. You believe in Cloud... right?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......I'm afraid to find out the truth...? But......why?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Hey, how are you? I just wanna know, which is it gonna be? You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out? Either way, you stay around here and about all you can do is worry about it. Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth... If it happens, it happens. I'll go upside your spikey white head and bring you back to normal!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud, it'll be all right. We're all with you."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"But..."},{"name":"Barret","line":"If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...You're...right. ......He's right, isn't he?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Come on, let's go and find Aeris...?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Aeris is here. ...and so is Sephiroth."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...it's not an excuse. I feel it in my soul."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...right. Let's hurry and find Aeris."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Ugh...what are you making me do."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"This can't be real!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Do not worry. Soon the girl will become part of the Planet's energy. All that is left is to go North. The 'Promised Land' waits for me over the snowy fields. There, I will become a new being by uniting with the planet. As will this girl......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...Shut up."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"The cycle of nature and your stupid plan don't mean a thing. Aeris is gone. Aeris will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry......or get angry......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What about us......what are WE supposed to do? What about my pain? My fingers are tingling. My mouth is dry. My eyes are burning!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"What are you saying? Are you trying to tell me you have feelings too?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Of course! Who do you think I am!?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Ha, ha, ha...... Stop acting as if you were sad. There's no need to act as though you're angry either."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Because, Cloud. You are..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I'm......a puppet?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I came here by my own free will... Or so I thought. However..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...To tell the truth, I'm afraid of myself."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...There is a part of me that I don't understand. That part that made me give the Black Materia to Sephiroth. If you hadn't stopped me, Aeris might have been..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...There's something inside of me. A person who is not really me. That's why I should quit this journey. Before I do something terrible."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"But I am going. He destroyed my hometown five years ago, killed Aeris, and is now trying to destroy the Planet. I'll never forgive...Sephiroth. I... I must go on."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...I have a favor to ask of you. Will you all come with me?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...to save me from doing something terrible."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I don't know how Aeris tried to save the planet from the Meteor. And I guess now, we'll never know."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"But! We still have a chance. We must get that Black Materia back before Sephiroth uses it."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Let's go."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...ugh."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Hmmm... Sephiroth said to me... Head North...... ......past the Snow Fields......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"So where did we land?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"It sure is cold. We'll freeze if we stay here any longer."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...I'll place a landmark, and start walking. (Place a landmark by pushing [OK] button)"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"We'll secure the route. You come up later."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"An old crater..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Something fell out of the sky and crashed down here...... Leaving a scar on the planet."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sephiroth took that energy and is trying to use Meteor. Next time the wound won't be so small."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sephiroth!!!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"You're right. This is the end of this body's usefulness."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"He disappeared!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"He might still be nearby......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Our...?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Master...!?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...hmm. So that's what this is all about. The Jenova Reunion..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Not Sephiroth!? You mean all this time it wasn't Sephiroth we've been after?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I'll explain later. Right now, the only thing I'm thinking about is beating Sephiroth."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"But Sephiroth is......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"He's here. The real Sephiroth is just beyond here. It's both incredibly wicked and cruel... But it's releasing a powerfully strong will from deep within this planet's wound."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...The Black Materia is back in our hands. Now all we have to do is defeat Sephiroth and that'll be the end of it."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"We'd better not take the Black Materia any further. Why don't you give it to someone else to hold on to?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"We're going in first! You guys stay and keep watch."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Calm down, Tifa. Sephiroth is near. Anything could happen."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Nibelheim..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"This is an illusion Sephiroth made up. He's trying to confuse us. It'll be all right. As long as we know it's an illusion, there's nothing to be afraid of. Come on, let's keep going."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Yeah, you're right..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Look!!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Stop...Sephiroth."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"This is so stupid..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Stop it already!!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...This is what actually happened five years ago. But... It's probably not me that's going to come out of the Shinra mansion. He's going to try and show us another stupid illusion."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"See...didn't I tell you?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I don't want to...watch this. Cloud...don't watch."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...What's wrong, Tifa? I told you before, right? As long as we know that it's just an illusion, there's no need to be scared."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say! That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago. That's it, isn't it?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"I see you finally understand."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What you are trying to say is that you want to confuse me, right? But...even making me see those things won't affect me. I remember it all. The heat of the fire...the pain in my body... and in my heart!"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Oh, is that so? You are just a puppet... You have no heart...and cannot feel any pain... How can there be any meaning in the memory of such a being? What I have shown you is reality. What you remember, that is the illusion."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I don't want to understand. But, I want to ask you one thing. Why...why are you doing this?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Ha, ha, ha...... I want to take you back to your real self. The one who gave me the Black Materia that day... Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so useful? Hojo would die if he knew."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Five years ago you were... ...constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim was burnt. A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the power of the Mako. An incomplete Sephiroth-clone. Not even given a number. ...That is your reality."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud... Don't listen to him... Close your ears! Close your eyes!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What's wrong, Tifa? I'm not affected by it. ...I wasn't paying attention to him."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"All that talk of Hojo constructing you is a lie. Don't we have our memories together? Being kids together, starlit nights..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Ha, ha, ha...Tifa... Why are you so worried and scared by those words? Hmm...Shall I show everyone here what's in your heart?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Ha, ha, ha... You look like you're not feeling well."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...Tifa? Is Sephiroth right?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Why are you so scared? Don't worry about me. I'm all right. No matter how confused I am, I'll never believe a word that Sephiroth says."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"It's true that sometimes I can't figure out who I am. There's a lot of things muddled up in my memories."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"But, Tifa...... But you said, 'Long time no see, Cloud' right? Those words will always support me. I am the one you grew up with. I'm Cloud of Nibelheim. No matter how much I lose faith in myself, that is the truth."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"That's why you shouldn't be so scared. No matter what anyone else says to me, it's your attitude that counts..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"No, that's not true, Cloud......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What's not? Aren't I the same Cloud you grew up with?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"That's not what I mean... I don't know how to say it... Cloud, I need some time... Just give me a little time..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Cloud... Don't blame Tifa. The ability to change one's looks, voice, and words, is the power of Jenova. Inside of you, Jenova has merged with Tifa's memories, creating you. Out of Tifa's memory...... A boy named Cloud might've just been a part of them."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud... Please...don't think right now."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"Ha, ha, ha...... Think, Cloud! ...Cloud? Ha, ha, ha......Oh, excuse me. You never had a name..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Shut up...Sephiroth."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"You still don't understand? Then... Do you remember the picture that we took before we headed for Mt. Nibel?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"...Tifa, you remember, right? But there is no way he would know. Now...what happened to that picture?"},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"......is this it? ...Do you want to see it? It turned out pretty good."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud...don't..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I...should be in the picture. Even if I'm not in there, no worry. This is just an illusory world Sephiroth made up."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...Just as I thought. This picture's a fake. The truth is in my memory. ...Five years ago, I came back to Nibelheim, to inspect the reactor. I was sixteen. The town hadn't changed at all. What did I do...? Oh yeah..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I spent the night and went to the reactor in Mt. Nibel. I was excited about it. Because that was my first mission after becoming First Class in SOLDIER."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...SOLDIER, First Class?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...SOLDIER? When did I enter SOLDIER? How did I join SOLDIER? Why...why can't I remember?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I'm...I'm..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"That's right..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...I didn't have to worry about it, because I was..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......Cloud?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Let's go, Tifa. I'm...I'm all right."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Everyone's waiting! Cloud's in trouble! Please come. Help us! Over there!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......hee hee hee... And remember..."},{"name":"Sephiroth","line":"...the Black Materia!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...don't know..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"This place is going to get rough. Better leave things to me and get out of here while you still can!!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"This is where the Reunion is happening. Where everything begins and ends."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud!!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"No, don't!!! Please! Stop Cloud!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Thanks. ......leave the rest to me"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Everyone, thanks for everything. And...I'm sorry."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...Sorry."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...Sorry."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Especially you, Tifa. I'm really sorry. You've been so good to me...... I don't know what to say..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I never lived up to being 'Cloud'. Tifa...... Maybe one day you'll meet the real 'Cloud'."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Professor Hojo... I don't have a number. You didn't give me one because you said I was a failed experiment."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Professor...please give me a number. Please, Professor..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Yes, that was how it got started."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I wasn't pursuing Sephiroth. I was being summoned by Sephiroth. All the anger and hatred I bore him, made it impossible for me to ever forget him. That and what he gave me."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sephiroth? Sephiroth? I'm here. And I brought you the Black Materia."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Show yourself to me. Where are you?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Sephiroth... So we finally meet again."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"What are you so happy about, Professor? You know what this means, don't you? Cloud has the Black Materia! Sephiroth is going to summon Meteor! Every single person is going to die!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud------!!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......I didn't know what to do. I was always like that..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"ohhh..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Ooouugh......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"oo...uh...agh"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Uh...uh...Tifa...?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Tifa...?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Tifa!"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"That's right. I'm Cloud."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Yeah, it's been a while."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......Yeah? It's nothing. I'm okay."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Five years."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What is it?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Actually, it's been seven years. You got your wish and joined SOLDIER, quit after the Sephiroth incident, and now you're a  mercenary..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"You told me a lot about what happened after you left Nibelheim... But... ...Something's wrong. I felt there was something strange about the things you talked about. All the things you didn't know that you should, And other things you shouldn't know that you did... I wanted to make sure...  But then I heard...you were going far away..."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Huh?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"The glare..."},{"name":"Barret","line":"You'll be better soon. You've been asleep for a long time."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I'm......hungry..."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Hey, why don't you ask?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"About him."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"...Because I'm scared."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Don't worry. I don't know what happened to Cloud either."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry... None of them know if he's all right either."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"He's still...alive, right?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"How long...was I asleep?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Lessee now...... Must've been about 7 days."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"What about Sephiroth?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"You ain't over it yet. Remember that huge light, in the Northern Cave? Since then, the crater's been surrounded by a huge barrier of light. Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in that big hole, protected by the barrier. We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he wakes up."},{"name":"Barret","line":"An' on topa that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on a rampage."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"...Weapon?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Remember that huge monster that was with Sephiroth, at the bottom of the crater? Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from the past."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Weapon...is protecting Sephiroth?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Dunno. But he's up here goin' around tearin' shit up. Right now Rufus' fightin' it. I hate to say it, but he's got guts."},{"name":"Barret","line":"We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but we ain't got no time..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Time..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"... Hey! How about Meteor?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"...Dunno."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"What are you going to do to Cloud?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Execution!? What're ya gonna get by executin' us?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"I take back what little praise I had for this damn jackass!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"The hell are these people?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"You make me sick..."},{"name":"Barret","line":"If you've gotta do it...do me first!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"What are you doing!?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Huh!? Sleeping gas?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Why you......? Ain't you part of Shinra?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Gas!!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Barret, help!!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Hold your breath! Hold on as long as you can!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Come on! I can't hold on forever!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Shi-!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Tifa! I'll help you, I promise!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Goddammit......!!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Why the airport? An' leave Tifa there?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"You damn cat......! What the hell're we gonna do now? They all be comin' soon!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Yo, better watch my back till the end...partner!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"First you lock me in this weird place, and now you're telling me to come out? Make up your mind!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"You okay?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"My cheeks hurt a bit."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Forget about that, what's all this about?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"I thought...... Tifa was gone for good."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Everyone? Everyone's here?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Not enough crew."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Meteor is coming, and Weapon is on the rampage...... At a time like this, I don't know what I'm supposed to do......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"No idea at all......"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Get a hold of yourself Tifa! C'mon, let's think about this! No way we can get offa this train we're on!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......If only Cloud was here, everything would be fine."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud would...... Stand that cocky little way he did, and tell us what to do. He'd say, 'Everything's under control, Tifa.'"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Tifa! When'd you become such a wimp!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I'm sorry Barret. I'm kind of shocked myself. I'm so depressed."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......I know. That's why I want to make sure. That's why I have to see him again."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......I'll be able to see him someday."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Deep within the earth......are you talking about the Lifestream?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"You got lost didn't you? Separated from someone you love......? Silly thing..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Wha!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Wh......wait a minute!! What did you just say!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Excuse me! That person you were just talking about......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud!! It must be!! It's Cloud!!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"So where is he? Is he safe!? Where is he now......?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"He's alive...! Cloud...... Cloud's alive!!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud......!!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I'm sorry, but I heard that a friend of mine was being taken care of here......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Here?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Over here."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud...!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Oh...Cloud!! I'm so glad you're safe!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud......?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Uh......aaa......?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Wh......what's wrong...... Cloud......?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"A...... Gurk......?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud! What happened to you......!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Doctor......!!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud......."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Why......? What do you want me to do?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Please, Cloud...... Talk to me....... Tell me you see me, that you can hear me...... Tell me, please......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I came this far believing in the memories we have together... This isn't happening......! This is too cruel......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Oh, Cloud......! I........."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"........."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Yes...... I'm sorry I had you all worried. And I have something I want to tell you all......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I don't care about anything else, only Cloud...... I......want to be by his side......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I'm sorry, everyone... At a time like this......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Right......"},{"name":"Barret","line":"What're we gonna do now! What can WE do?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do? An' don' go tellin' us to wait for Cloud to get better."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Yeah, what!? That you a spy?"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Can't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Besides, when Cloud gets back, I wanna show him this Huge Materia. He's gonna be shocked."},{"name":"Barret","line":"I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. You just...shut your face!"},{"name":"Barret","line":"Every group's gotta have a leader. An' that's me! Or at least I wanna be... But I ain't cut out to be no leader. I never knew that till lately."},{"name":"Barret","line":"An' that's what is......"},{"name":"Barret","line":"You been chosen to be the new leader."},{"name":"Barret","line":"But for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you.

Where am I......?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"What is it, Cloud? What is this......!? Is this the inside of your dreams? Or is it...... your......subconsciousness......?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"You're searching, aren't you Cloud? Searching......for yourself......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I can help too. We'll work together to try and get the real you back!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"But...... Where do we start......?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"It connects....... to Nibelheim......?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"That's right... It's probably best to start from there......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud...look."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Here's the well..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"And that's Gramps' Inn, too."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"The only truck in town. It's been here since we were little kids, right?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"This is the Nibelheim you remember, right? It's the same as my Nibelheim. That's why this place is......our Nibelheim."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Five Years ago...I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first time."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"So this is...the Great Sephiroth."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"But to tell you the truth, I thought he was very cold."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I remember, I felt a foreboding about him."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"No, Cloud. I've been hiding it for some time, afraid that if I told you ...something terrible might happen. But, I'm not going to hide anything anymore."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"You weren't here. Cloud did not come to Nibelheim five years ago."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I...waited. But, Cloud...never came. The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another person..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth wasn't......Cloud......?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"There's nothing...... I can say...... You must find the answer yourself...... If you can't...... Then you......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Take your time, Cloud. Slowly......little by little, okay?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Don't hurry, Cloud...... Don't answer too quickly. Just keep checking all those small emotions and it'll come back...... Slowly......little by little......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Right...like the sky that night...... the heavens were filled with stars......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"From the beginning...OK?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Try and remember, Cloud."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Right, I was wearing these clothes."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"That's you, too. You were so small then......  ...and cute."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Sephiroth once said... Cloud made up his memories by listening to my stories... Did you imagine this sky? No, you remembered it."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"That night the stars were gorgeous. It was just Cloud and I. We talked at the well... That's why I continued to believe that you were the real Cloud."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I still believe you're the Cloud from Nibelheim... But you don't believe in yourself... These memories aren't enough."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud, what about your other memories?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"No, not memories. A memory is something that has to be consciously recalled, right? That's why sometimes it can be mistaken and a different thing......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"But it's different from a memory locked deep within your heart...... That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that memory......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"That's it! What about some memory that has to do with me? I say something and you don't remember it...... But you say something, and I remember it, too... Then we'll know that's our memory......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the first place? I always thought it was a sudden decision you made......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"......I was devastated. ......I wanted to be noticed."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I thought if I got stronger I could get someone to notice......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Someone to notice you...? ......who?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Who......? ......You know who! ......You, that's who."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"You......."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"......Me? Why!?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Tifa......did you forget...... about those days?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Look......I...... I'm sorry...... But what are you talking about?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"No......it's all right. You were having a hard time back then. You were so busy with your own things, it's only natural you don't remember me back then."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"'Back then'?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"It's important to me...... I hate to say it but... It's a very important memory...... Do you want to see it?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"My room?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"It was my first time there."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Was...it?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I only used to look up at it from outside."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Was that the first day you came into my room?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"...that's right. We lived next to each other. But I really didn't know you that well."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"I've known you since we were children and always thought we were close..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Now that you mention it...I don't recall you ever being in my room..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Tifa always used to be with this three-some."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"...That's right."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I used to think...they were all stupid."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"What!?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"You were all childish, laughing at every little stupid thing."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"But we were children, back then."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"...I know. I'm the one that was stupid. I really wanted to play with everyone, but I was never allowed into the group."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Then later... I began to think I was different... That I was different from those immature kids. That then...maybe..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Just maybe, they would invite me in. I thought that might happen, so I hung around..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I was so prejudiced. And...weak."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"That night I called Tifa out to the well... I thought to myself Tifa would never come...that she hated me."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Yeah...it was so sudden. I was...a bit surprised."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"But... It's true that we weren't THAT close, but... After you left town, I really thought about you a lot. I used to wonder how Cloud was doing. I wonder if Cloud was able to get into SOLDIER? I started reading the newspapers, thinking that there might be an article about you."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Thanks, Tifa. Tell him what you told me, later. He'll probably be so happy."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"OK!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Huh? What happened on this day? Was it a special day?\nThis was the day..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Tifa's mother..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"The day Mom died..."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Tifa was in a coma for seven days. We all thought she wouldn't make it. If only I could've saved her... I was so angry... Angry at myself for my weakness."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Ever since then, I felt Tifa blamed me...

Then even Tifa would have to notice me......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"So that was it......"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Sorry, Cloud.

Zack..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"You remembered!!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"That's right! It was Zack who came to Nibelheim with Sephiroth!"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Then, where were you, Cloud?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud... Did you...see it all?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I saw...everything..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Cloud!?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"That's what happened..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"...You were there. You were watching me."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Yeah, I remember."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Hmm...so it was you."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Yeah...this is...me. I...never made it as a member of SOLDIER. I even left my hometown telling everyone I was going to join, but... I was so embarrassed...... I didn't want to see anybody..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"...You came. ...You kept your promise.

He's a tough one."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Barret......I...... When I was in the Lifestream I saw the real Cloud. I mean, I didn't really find him.

I made up the stories about what happened to me five years ago, about being in SOLDIER. I left my village looking for glory, but never made it in to SOLDIER...... I was so ashamed of being so weak; then I heard this story from my friend Zack... And I created an illusion of myself made up of what I had seen in my life...... And I continued to play the charade as if it were true."},{"name":"Barret","line":"Illusion, huh...? Pretty damn strong for a 'lusion, I'd say."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I'm physically built like someone in SOLDIER. Hojo's plan to clone Sephiroth wasn't that difficult. It was just the same procedure they use when creating members of SOLDIER."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"You see, someone in SOLDIER isn't simply exposed to Mako energy. Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells......"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"For better or worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER. It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion. But weak people......like me, get lost in the whole thing."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth's strong will, and my own weakness are what created me.

First off, if you're nervous a lot, you won't get sick. But you can't always be nervous."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"With this much space, your best bet is to move around while you're riding.

What're you doing!?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"There are generations of knowledge and wisdom inside the Materia. We're gonna borrow their powers and save the planet from Sephiroth.

You up to somethin'?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"I've...been thinking too. About the universe...planet...ocean. How wide and big...

I don't think that's it at all. I think she didn't think she would die at all, but that she planned on coming back all along. She always used to talk about the 'Next time'.

I'll do the rest."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Thank you...Aeris."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"Aeris' voice has already reached the Planet. Just look at the glow of the White Materia.

I want us all to understand that. Save the planet...for the future of the planet... Sure, that's all fine. But really, is that really how it is?"},{"name":"Cloud","line":"For me, this is a personal feud. I want to beat Sephiroth. And settle my past.

A very personal memory that I have. What about you all?  I want all of you to find that something within yourselves. If you don't find it, then that's okay too. You can't fight without a reason, right? So, I won't hold it against you if you don't come back."},{"name":"Cloud","line":"What are you going to do, Tifa?"},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Did you forget?

I wonder...? Everyone has an irreplaceable something they're holding on to... But this time, our opponent..."},{"name":"Tifa","line":"Hmm...But that's all right, even if no one comes back.
